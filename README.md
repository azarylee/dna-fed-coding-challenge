# Front End Developer Coding Challenge

## Webpack

I used the webpack to replace Parcel.js. When I used Vue.js that I need dynamic to load the image. However, I search many articles by google, Parcel.js currently can not support this. That is the reason why I used webpack. I created three js document to resolve start the project and build the project.

## Sass

I used Sass and do some mixin so that can reuse in different situation, and also reduce the coding and look clearly.

## Getting started

Install the project dependencies:

`npm install` or `yarn install`

Then start a local server:

`npm run start` or `yarn start`

I will prefer to use the yarn, it will quicker than npm and when install once, it can be install offline later.

Last but not least, thank you for give me this opportunity to do this, I really enjoy it.
